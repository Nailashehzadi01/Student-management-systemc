Student Information System (SIS) - Student Record Management Software:
Introduction: The Student Information System (SIS) or Student Record Management Software is designed to automate and streamline various administrative tasks in educational institutions. It provides efficient management of student-related information, including attendance, admission, fees, documents, results, health records, and extracurricular activities. This project aims to develop a Student Information System using C++ programming language, incorporating the specified functionalities.
Q1 – Analysis of the complete model of Student Information System (SIS) and its development: 
The Student Information System (SIS) is a comprehensive software solution that simplifies administrative tasks and improves the efficiency of educational institutions. It comprises several modules that handle different aspects of student management. The development of an SIS involves designing and implementing these modules to provide a seamless experience for administrators, teachers, students, and parents. Here is an analysis of the key modules:
Attendance Management: This module allows teachers to mark and view attendance for students. It also enables sharing attendance status with parents. It includes features like generating attendance reports, tracking staff attendance, and integrating with biometric systems if available.
Admission Management: The admission management module automates the entire admission process. It facilitates online form submission, fee payment, batch allotment, and document submission. It ensures quick and accurate collection of student information during the admission process.
Managing Record of Admitted Students: This module focuses on maintaining a comprehensive record of admitted students. It includes their personal details, contact information, parents' details, academic records, and any other relevant information. It ensures easy retrieval and updating of student records.
Fee Management Record: The fee management module handles tasks related to fee collection, record-keeping, receipt generation, dues management, and refunds. It allows administrators to define fee cycles and provides reports on fee-related information.
Attendance Management: Similar to the teacher attendance management, this module allows administrators to track the attendance of staff members. It includes features like leave management, attendance reports, and integration with payroll systems.
Students Results and Performance Record: This module focuses on recording and managing students' academic performance and results. It allows teachers to enter and update marks, generate report cards, and provide performance insights. It may include features like grade calculation and graphical representation of results.
Students Health Fitness and Disability Record: This module handles the storage and management of students' health-related information, including medical history, allergies, disabilities, and fitness records. It ensures easy access to health information for timely interventions and supports.
Students Participation and Extra Curricular Activities Record: This module enables tracking and documenting students' participation in extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs, events, and competitions. It helps in recognizing achievements, promoting talent, and organizing related activities.
Q2 – Development of Student Information System (SIS) using C++ programming language:
 To develop the Student Information System (SIS) using C++, you need to implement the following functionalities:
Current Status of Students: Implement a feature to track the current status of students, such as whether they are in-studies, left the institution, or graduated.
Admission Management: Design a module that handles the admission process, including online form submission, fee payment, batch allotment, and document submission.
Managing Record of Admitted Students: Create a data structure or database to store and manage the records of admitted students. Include fields for personal information, contact details, parents' information, academic records, etc.
Fee Management Record: Develop a module that manages fee-related tasks, such as fee collection, record-keeping, receipt generation, dues management, and refunds. Consider implementing a fee cycle management system.
Attendance Management: Implement features for teachers to mark and view attendance for students. Provide options to share attendance status with parents. Also, develop the functionality to track staff attendance.
Students Results and Performance Record: Create a system to record and manage students' academic results and performance. Allow teachers to enter and update marks, generate report cards, and provide performance insights.
Students Health Fitness and Disability Record: Design a module to store and manage students' health-related information, including medical history, allergies, disabilities, and fitness records. Ensure proper data handling and privacy measures.
Students Participation and Extra Curricular Activities Record: Develop a feature that allows tracking and documenting students' participation in extracurricular activities. Provide options to record their achievements, manage clubs or teams, and organize related activities.
